# MDX Blog

Created with Next.js, MDX and Tailwindcss, this third iteration of my personal
blog includes better and lighter styles than the chakra version and a huge
performance boost compared to the CMS iteration.

Although I used `next-mdx-remote` for the markdown engine, I would like to use
`mdx-bundler` instead since it uses mdx-v2 rather than mdx-v1.
